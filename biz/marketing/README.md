# Marketing
We will put all of our marketing strategies and plans in here.

## Overview
Connecting consumers and businesses in the post-transaction world.
* Adding value to the post-transactional business relationship with reviews and rewards.

### Overview (detailed/scenarios)
* Every business transaction is a relationship experience between business and customer
* Every business relationship has a **before**, **during**, and **after** transaction experience
  * **Before transaction** is marketing, advertising, and research
  * **During transcation** is the purchase process itself
  * **After transaction** typically consists of receipts, reviews, and surveys
* A lot of emphasis is typically put into the **Before** and **During** transaction experience, but what about the **After**?
* Both businesses and consumers each have their own **After** experience
  * Consumers are either satisfied or disatisfied with their purchase/experience
  * Businesses want the customer to return and buy again
