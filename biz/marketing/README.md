# Marketing
We will put all of our marketing stratigies and plans in here.

## Overview
Adding value to the post-transactional business relationship with reviews and rewards.

### Overview (detailed/scenarios)
* Every business transaction is a relationship experience between business and customer
* Every business relationship has a **before**, **during**, and **after** transaction experience
  * **Before transaction** is marketing, advertising, and research
  * **During transcation** is the purchase process itself
  * **After transaction** typically consists of receipts, reviews, and surveys
* We can all agree that a lot of emphasis is put into the **Before** and **During** transaction experience, but what about the **After**?
* Both businesses and consumers each have their own **After** experience
  * Consumers are either satisfied or disatisfied with their purchase/experience
  * Businesses want the customer to return and buy again
  * How much emphasis is put into the **After** experience? 
  
### Businesses
You've just made a successful business transaction with a customers. Now what?
1. Be able to thank your customers for their business "personally"
2. Continue that relationship with that customer post-transaction

#### 1. Thank your customers for their business "personally"
Your customers are more than just a number. Each one of them is a human being, not a bot.

#### 2. Continue that relationship with that customer post-transaction
A new customer is valuable and exciting, however, a returning customer is even better.

### Consumers
You've just made a purchase with a business. Now what?
1. Let the business (and the rest of the world) know how satisfied you were with the experience
2. Have a need, question, or problem that developed after the transaction?
