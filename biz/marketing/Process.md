## The business to consumer relationship
The business relationship experience between consumers and businesses can be broken down into three phases:

1. **Before the transaction**
2. **During the transaction**
3. **After the transaction**

### 1. Before the transaction experience
It's very common for businesses to advertise, promote, and market their products or services. This allows consumers to gain knowledge or awareness of that particular product or service **before any transactions occur**. 

### 2. During the transaction experience
Consumers who find value in a business's product or service can ultimately make a purchase. Factors like pricing, availability, and customer service provides the customer with a certain experience **during the transaction**.

### 3. After the transaction experience
The "After the transaction experience" typically come in the form of receipts, returns, and warranties. One other element that is typically found here is reviews of the product or service.

### Notes
* Every business transaction is a relationship experience between business and customer
* Every business relationship has a **before**, **during**, and **after** transaction experience
  * **Before transaction** is marketing, advertising, and research
  * **During transcation** is the purchase process itself
  * **After transaction** typically consists of receipts, reviews, and surveys
* A lot of emphasis is typically put into the **Before** and **During** transaction experience, but what about the **After**?
* Both businesses and consumers each have their own **After** experience
  * Consumers are either satisfied or disatisfied with their purchase/experience
  * Businesses want the customer to return and buy again
