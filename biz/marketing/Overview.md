# Overview

## What is Rewardful?
*Rewardful* is an online reviews and rewards platform designed to enhance the post-transactional relationship between businesses and their customers.

## How does it work?
After a business transaction, the relationship between the business and the consumer typically has no value and simply ends. *Rewardful* is designed to provide both parties the opportunity to continue adding value to that business relationship in the forms of reviews and rewards.

* **Reviews**: A customer can leave a business a review for their product or service
* **Rewards**: The business can then thank--or reward--that customer for their business and review

## What makes Rewardful different from other review platforms?
*Rewardful* is designed to enhance the overall experience and value proposition of customer reviews in the online business to consumer (B2C) world.

## What problems do Rewardful help solve?
Online customer reviews are meant to be a tool for consumers to provide feedback of their customer experience to a business, however, they are typically handled as an afterthought to the business relationship. 

Businesses generally do not provide the same level of marketing attention or service to **customer reviews** when compared to **promotions, coupons, and advertising**.

* Majority of consumers do not write or respond to reviews or surveys in general
* **Positive reviews** rarely receive recognition or praise
* **Negative reviews** are often given without the opportunity to rectify the cause of the negative experience

## Notes
Reviews can provide valuable feedback to both the business and fellow consumers regarding the product or service provided.

There is an unbalance in the number of **satisfied/unsatisfied customer experiences** to **positive/negative review feedback**
