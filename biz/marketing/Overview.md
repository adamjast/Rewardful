# Overview

## What is Rewardful?
*Rewardful* is an online reviews and rewards platform designed to enhance the post-transactional relationship between businesses and their customers.

## How does it work?
After a business transaction, the relationship between the business and the consumer typically has no value and simply ends. *Rewardful* is designed to provide both parties the opportunity to continue adding value to that business relationship in the forms of reviews and rewards.

* **Reviews**: A customer can leave a business a review for their product or service
* **Rewards**: The business can then thank--or reward--that customer for their business and review

## What makes Rewardful different from other review platforms?
Online customer reviews are meant to be a tool for consumers to provide feedback of their customer experience to the business, however, they are typically handled as an afterthought to the business relationship. 

*Rewardful* is designed to change and enhance overall experience and value proposition of customer reviews in the online business to consumer (B2C) world.
