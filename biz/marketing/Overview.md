# Overview

## What is Rewardful?
Rewardful is an online reviews and rewards platform designed to enhance the post-transactional relationship between businesses and their customers.

## How does it work?
After a business transaction, the relationship between the business and the consumer typically has no value and simply ends.

Rewardful is designed to provide both parties the opportunity to continue adding value to that business relationship in the forms of reviews and rewards.

* **Reviews**: A customer can leave a business a review for their product or service
* **Rewards**: The business can then thank--or reward--that customer for their business and review

## What makes Rewardful different from other review platforms?


### Notes
* Every business transaction is a relationship experience between business and customer
* Every business relationship has a **before**, **during**, and **after** transaction experience
  * **Before transaction** is marketing, advertising, and research
  * **During transcation** is the purchase process itself
  * **After transaction** typically consists of receipts, reviews, and surveys
* A lot of emphasis is typically put into the **Before** and **During** transaction experience, but what about the **After**?
* Both businesses and consumers each have their own **After** experience
  * Consumers are either satisfied or disatisfied with their purchase/experience
  * Businesses want the customer to return and buy again
