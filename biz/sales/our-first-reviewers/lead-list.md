Hi Thomas,

My name is Shun Shiga and I found your review for Over The Top Pita in Clermont yesterday and decided to give the place a shot.

(I ordered the Gyro Pita...it was very good!)

I'm reaching out to you now because I want businesses to know that reviews like your's has helped generate new business. 

I'm currently working on a new app that would allow local businesses to reward (or resolve) online reviews BEFORE they're posted live on review platforms like Yelp and TripAdvisor. 

Ideally, if the business has the opportunity to reward positive reviews, or fix the situations brought up in negative reviews before they're posted live, the app could:

- Help reduce the number of negative reviews posted on a business's profile
- Encourage more users to write more online reviews
- Ultimately help continue the business-to-consumer relationship after the business transaction has taken place with special rewards or offers to reviewers

If this sounds like an interesting or helpful feature, I'm currently looking for some fellow Yelpers who wouldn't mind providing some feedback during the development of the app. Together, we can help make online reviews become more valuable to both consumers and businesses.

Look forward to hearing your thoughts. 

Thanks,

Shun
