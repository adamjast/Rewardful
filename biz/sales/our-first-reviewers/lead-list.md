Hi Thomas,

My name is Shun Shiga and I found your review for Over The Top Pita in Clermont yesterday and decided to give the place a shot.

(I ordered the Gyro Pita...it was very good!)

I'm reaching out to you now because I want businesses to know that your Yelp review helped generate new business. 

I'm currently working on an app that would allow local businesses to engage with online reviews, even before they're posted live on review platforms like Yelp and TripAdvisor.

Here's how it would work:

To encourage engagement to both positive and negative reviews, businesses would have a limited opportunity to either thank and reward you for your positive review, or resolve any negative feedback. Once that engagement takes place, the review would then be posted live. If your review then starts creating new business, they could continue rewarding you with special offers or discounts.

I'm currently looking for some fellow Yelpers who would find this feature useful and wouldn't mind providing some feedback during the development of the app. Together, we can help make online reviews become more valuable to both consumers and businesses.

Look forward to hearing your thoughts. 

Thanks,

Shun
