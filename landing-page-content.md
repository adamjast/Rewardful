# Rewardful

## Make reviews rewarding

Rewardful is an online review platform that allows businesses to reward or resolve customer reviews before they're posted live.

## Why let businesses read reviews first?

### Feedback that works.

Had a bad experience? 

Tell the business owner. 

Most reputable business owners will try to fix the issue and prevent it from happening again. 

On the contrary, if you go ahead and tell the whole world about your bad experience first, that'll just piss off the business owner. That's a lose-lose situation.

### Create engagement

When you first meet someone new, you say hello.

When you go to a restaurant, you pay for a meal.

When you write an online review, well...what happens next?

Something feels missing right? (Maybe?)

**Think of it this way:** If somebody said something nice about you, wouldn't you like to thank him or her for their nice comment? 

Of course!

Now if somebody had a complaint about you, wouldn't it be ideal to discuss the issue with them one-on-one? How would you feel if that complaint was instead spread across the entire internet without a chance for you to rectify the issue, or worse, behind your back? 

### Solution: Make the conversation engaging

We can make both positive and negative reviews have a bigger impact by allowing both parties to first engage in the conversation personally before publishing it to the rest of the world. 

adding personal engagement between both parties.

That's what Rewardful is designed to do with customer reviews.

## What would make online reviews more helpful?

**Businesses**, what can previous customers do to make reviews more helpful or useful to you?

**Consumers**, what type of information would be most useful to you when reading reviews?
