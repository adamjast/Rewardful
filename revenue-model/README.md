# Revenue Model
How we charge our users for the service.

## Merchant
### Current
#### Per Location
We will not charge any merchant that has 0-1 location.  1+ locations will have a charge some determined value later.  For now lets just use $5 per month per location.  For example if a merchant has 6 locations to monitor then it would be (($5 x 6) - 1) = $25 for the month.
