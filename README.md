# Rewardful
## Simple One Line Definition
### Current
A online reviews and rewards platform designed to enhance the post-transactional relationship between businesses and their customers.
### Proposed
- Reviews directly to the local business.
- A software platform that allows local business reviews to reach the owner first
 * Shun: this is more of a feature, not global definition

## Initial Problems
Problems that this product is trying to solve
- Submitting a negative review to the public before a owner can resolve it.
- Increase the number of positive customers reviews (more likely to write a review for a negative experience, but rarely for positive)
- Increase the quality of customer reviews (*"Tried the Avocado Bacon Beast Burger. My favorite!"* vs *"great food great service"*)

## Live
You can find the app for [merchants here](http://biz-rewardful.jastcode.com) and [reviewers here](http://rewardful.jastcode.com)

## Why
[fill after one line definition is established...]
- Continue the B2C relationship after the transaction
- #Merchants want feedback, endorsements, and the ability to provide post-transaction customer service
- #Reviewers like coupons, direct conversation, rewards/recognition, notifications.
- A software platform that allows local business to recognize, reward, and/or rectify a customer review

### Proposals

## Features
- Reviews post to users platform of choice.
- Pending period between review submission and review post.
- Resolution option for merchants on pending reviews.

Things we need to do.
