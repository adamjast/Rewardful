## Initial Problems
Problems that this product is trying to solve
- Submitting a negative review to the public before a owner can resolve it.
- Increase the number of positive customers reviews (more likely to write a review for a negative experience, but rarely for positive)
- Increase the quality of customer reviews (*"Tried the Avocado Bacon Beast Burger. My favorite!"* vs *"great food great service"*)
