## Initial Problems
Problems that this product is trying to solve
- Submitting a negative review to the public before a owner can resolve it.
- Increase the number of positive customers reviews (more likely to write a review for a negative experience, but rarely for positive)
- Increase the quality of customer reviews (*"Tried the Avocado Bacon Beast Burger. My favorite!"* vs *"great food great service"*)

## Live
You can find the app for [merchants here](http://biz-rewardful.jastcode.com) and [reviewers here](http://rewardful.jastcode.com)

## Why
[fill after one line definition is established...]
- Continue the B2C relationship after the transaction
- 'Merchants' want feedback, endorsements, and the ability to provide engaging customer service after the visit or transaction.
- 'Reviewers' like coupons, direct conversation, rewards/recognition, notifications.
- A software platform that allows local business to recognize, reward, and/or rectify a customer review

### Current

### Proposals
- ONE LINE: A software platform that allows local business reviews to reach the owner first.
