Situations that can create friction or decrease the user experience.
### Current
#### For Merchants

1. How to remove negative reviews on Yelp
 - Owner must be aware of the negative review(s)
 - Owner must directly contact the Yelper and ask them to change their rating
 - Even if owner receives more recent positive reviews, Yelp will *still* show older negative reviews

 - Takes too much time
 - "I'm not a good writer"
 - Forgot
 
### For Development
#### For Merchants

1. Spammy reviews
 - How to decipher fake vs authentic customer reviews
  - **"Check in"** to the restaurant (Problem: extra step for Reviewer)
  - **Take a picture** of your visit (Problem: extra step for Reviewer; fake pictures)
  - **Receipt code** (Problem: extra step for Reviewer; majority of customers throw away receipts)
 - 'Merchant' wants to know if reviews are legitimate
2. How to deliver a reward
 - App sends a notification with a link to the merchant's reward/offer
 - Systematically (i.e. using Yelp platform)
  - + Piggyback off of Yelp
  - - Difficult to set up rules
 - Attach a file (i.e. PDF)
  - + Easy to program
  - - Not universal
  - - No quality control 
3. Crowd control: How do businesses keep up with a surge of review submissions?
 - Set pending period
 - Extra benefit: Allows business to send a notification to the customer on a new day
4. Crowd control: How to prevent reviewers from setting expectations that every business will reward you for a review 

#### For Reviewers

2. Pending period between review submission and review post.
3. Resolution opportunity for merchants on pending reviews.

### Proposals
1. Reviewers can receive rewards (or a resolution) for their business review.
2. Engagement Score
 - Stand out from the rest of the 4.5 star reviews with a Customer Enagagement Score
 - Engage positive reviews by thanking or rewarding them
 - Engage negative reviews by providing a fix, resolution, or apology
 - The more reviews a business engages with, the higher the business's Engagement score

## 7. Why
[fill after one line definition is established...]
- Continue the B2C relationship after the transaction
- 'Merchants' want feedback, endorsements, and the ability to provide engaging customer service after the visit or transaction.
- 'Reviewers' like coupons, direct conversation, rewards/recognition, notifications.
- A software platform that allows local business to recognize, reward, and/or rectify a customer review

### Current
[select]
### Proposals
- ONE LINE: A software platform that allows local business reviews to reach the owner first.
 - WHY: If the owner gets the ability to see the review before it is posted to the public there might be a window of resolution or clarity between the owner and reviewer.
