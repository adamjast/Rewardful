## Notifications are the next platform
(https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/21/notifications-are-the-next-platform/)
* Notifications will be the starting point (or "front door") for all of the interactions on your phone.
* Before mobile, the web was very "pull-driven" (we proactively find information on websites as we need)
* With mobile, our engagement is now defined by push-driven notifications rather than pull-driven experience
  * The apps that notify us (without over-notifying to the point of uninstall) are rewarded with our engagement.
* Both iOS and Android are exposing more actions at the notification panel level, often eliminating the need to go into the app
  * Think of archiving an email or quickly responding to an iMessage
  * @benedictevans: Facebook isn't taking on WeChat. It's taking on the iOS/Android notification panel
