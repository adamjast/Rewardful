Your customers are more than just a number. Each one of them is a human being, not a bot.

#### 2. Encourage them to shop with you again
A new customer is valuable and exciting, however, a returning customer is even more valuable.

#### 3. Be in control of your online customer service
The post-transaction relationship today includes customer reviews, which can make or break a business's reputation. Keep your online presence under control by maintaining post-transactional relationships with your customers.
